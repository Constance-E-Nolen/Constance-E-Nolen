-  Hi, I’m @Constance-E-Nolen
-  I’m interested in Animation, CAD, writing, poetry, and landscape Architecture. 
-  I’m currently learning CAD, programming, 2D framing, 3D character and backdrop design, and computer programing. 
-  I am interested in collaborating on novel, fan, or short story writting. Including poetry. I have a story breakdown/proof reading service already set up.

-  I truly hope all of you succeed in life.
